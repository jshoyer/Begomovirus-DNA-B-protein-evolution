# Begomovirus DNA-B protein evolution

This code supports a paper

The R script
was used to make a co-phylogeny tanglegram
(Figure 4 in the paper).


The code for Shannon entropy calculations
(Table 1)
was adapted from python code
written by Erik Lavington
— protein_diversity_proposal.ipynb
at https://github.com/elavington/CRESS-DNA-virus

Code was simplified a bit more
for a subsequent paper
— see https://github.com/acrespo-virevol/shannon-entropy
